最近对用户画像（persona）领域比较感兴趣，以下为相关的一些抛砖引玉式总结。<br/>
目前用户画像同时对应到英文术语里的user persona和user profile. 为了阐述方便，本文统一用PERSONA.
(wip)

## Introduction
A persona, (also user persona, customer persona, buyer persona) in user-centered design and marketing is a fictional character created to represent a user type that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way[<sup>1</sup>](#refer-anchor-1). This concept has been influential in computer software engineering[<sup>2</sup>](#refer-anchor-2).
The term Persona originated from Alan Cooper[<sup>5</sup>](#refer-anchor-5), who described Personas as a concrete representation of target users. In software engineering, persona could be interpreted as the 2 parts:
- Analyze user behavior data, generate tags for users
- Build applications upon these tags. 

These tags could be categorized as[<sup>3</sup>](#refer-anchor-3):
- Statistics based tags: e.g. people who visited the site last week
- Rule based tags: e.g. frequent buyer, the rule could be specified as buyers who purchased more than twice last week
- AI based tags: e.g. interested buyer of luxury bags 

Typical applications include:
- Provide personalized recommendation service to buyers, e.g. <a style="color:#FF4500;text-decoration:none">frequent buyers of organic vegetables</a>. When these buyers are shopping food online, it is more suitable to recommend organic vegetables instead of other vegetables 
- Identify suitable audiences for online marketing, e.g. send push notification to <a style="color:#FF4500;text-decoration:none">interested buyers of Apple products</a> upon the arrival of new Apple products
- Prevention of Customer Churn, e.g. identify the users who recently became <a style="color:#FF4500;text-decoration:none">inactive users</a>

## High-level Technical Solution
This is a brief summary of User Persona Architecture.

### Offline Tag Generation
There are multiple layers for Tag Generation.
- In the database layer, we run ETL(Extract-Transform-Load) jobs to extract the snapshot of domain data, tracking data, log data to Data warehouse(DW)
- In the DW layer, we run Spark jobs to aggregate multiple DW tables, generate rule/statistics based tags. E.g frequent buyer, active user. Persist the results in a temporary DW table. Sometimes we also leverage on AI algorithms to learn user behavior and generate AI-based tags. E.g. potential buyer of Tesla.
- In the Tag Store layer, ingest the results into Elastic Search, NoSQL database, Clickhouse, Distributed Storage System, Distributed Cache etc. Sometimes we also need RDBMS to persist the metadata of tags. 

### Near real time Tag Generation
It takes hours or even days for the offline tag generation, therefore, the result reflects the status of yesterday. 
In most scenarios it is sufficient. However, sometimes it is not sufficient. 
For instance, Jack and Rose used to be potential buyers of Instant Noodle. However, due to the breaking news of Instant Noodle food quality scandal, they both blocked Instant Noodle in their social media accounts.
In this case it is quite obvious it is not suitable to show Instant Noodle advertisements to them. Seeing these advertisements, they might feel irritated or even move to other platforms.
To avoid this situation, lets assume there is a Kafka event fired for the blocking action, the event of their real time actions should be processed, their tag store should also be updated with the results of real time Kafka events.  

### Using Tags in Applications
When tags persisted, applications could read these tags and use them in marketing service, recommendation service etc.  
To achieve this, a tagging service should be developed. This tagging service provides APIs to applications. Typical use cases include:
- When a user logins in the Movie APP, the tagging API returns the tags of this user. E.g. if this user is a frequent viewer, show an Ad for membership upgrade.  
- Upon the new arrival of Apple products, send push notifications to the frequent buyers.

## Applications in industry 
这一章节主要市国内工业界用户画像的典型应用。主要内容参考自InfoQ用户画像实践专刊[<sup>4</sup>](#refer-anchor-4)。
在用户画像的用途上普遍提到新用户的发展，用户流失的预测，个性化推荐，精细化运营。
针对不同业务类型，美团外卖的技术文章提到”不像传统电商用户在决策前有大量的浏览行为可以用于捕捉用户单次的需求。因此更需要结合用户画像分析用户的历史兴趣、以及用户的消费场景，在消费前对用户做适当的引导、推荐。“[<sup>4</sup>](#refer-anchor-4)
去哪儿还将用户画像用户用户体验提升。携程的技术文章认为，事实类的画像一般实时计算，复合类的画像一般异步计算。且强调了画像数据隐私保护的重要性。一些通用实践中，常见使用hbase存储（近）实时计算结果，ES存储离线计算结果。
以下架构图来自该文章[<sup>4</sup>](#refer-anchor-4)。

神策数据将tag分类为[<sup>6</sup>](#refer-anchor-6)
- 基于营销触点
- 基于增长漏斗
- 基于用户价值
- 基于用户偏好


近年来，随着clickhouse的流行,越来越多的企业开始使用它来存储用户画像tag数据，作为ES的补充，着重解决以下痛点[<sup>8</sup>](#refer-anchor-8)[<sup>9</sup>](#refer-anchor-9)

- ElasticSearch写入速度慢，大吞吐写入容易OOM；
- ElasticSearch存储成本高：行存压缩率低、_source原文、双副本
- ElasticSearch稠密索引：构建速度慢，全列索引空间膨胀严重
- ElasticSearch优势场景是搜索，而非分析
- ElasticSearch更改schema复杂，涉及到index结构变化

clickhouse集成RoaringBitmap使用可以实现秒级查询完成六亿用户圈选[<sup>8</sup>](#refer-anchor-8). 且相对于 ElasticSearch 的配置，可以节约一半硬件资源。
当然，相对于es弊端也是明显的，对于高并发的支持，如何让离线计算结果和在线计算结果写入的时候可以方便的CONDITIONAL WRITE。

## Challenges And Pain Points
- Learning curves

The whole Persona system is complex and requires skill sets in multiple fields, machine learning, data engineering, marketing, HCI etc.
That said, there are learning curves in both designing valuable tags and developing efficient tagging system.
However, business scenarios usually require agile development of tags and applications[<sup>4</sup>](#refer-anchor-4).

- Requirements of online applications

It is possible that the online applications have the following requirements:
1) Low latency
2) High TPS
3) Data size

E.g. there are millions of people with the tag active users, however, we do need to query the large list of results efficiently. 
This brings challenges to designing tag store.


- Near real time

Sometimes we need to support near real time tagging, this brings extra complexity. Namely how to merge the results of offline spark job and online kafka events processing. When ingesting the results, there might also be race condition between Spark job results and kafka consumer results.
